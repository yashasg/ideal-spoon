## User Directive Consolidation: Squad:Yashas & Issue #4 (2026-04-29T05-07–12-13Z)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**By:** yashasg (via Copilot)
**Status:** Merged; enforced across Frank/Linus/Rusty/Basher batch

### Directives

1. **2026-04-29T05:07:32Z:** Things assigned to `yashasg` can be marked with `squad:yashas`; Squad should ignore those.
2. **2026-04-29T05:16:38Z:** Do not wait for user input while user is away; continue Ralph loop, skip `squad:yashas` work, process available Squad-owned work.
3. **2026-04-29T11:25:22Z:** Prefer implementation instructions at top of scaffold files instead of README as primary nav.
4. **2026-04-29T12:13:37Z:** Anything marked `squad:yashas` is human-owned and should be ignored by Squad unless explicitly requested. Issue #4 has `squad:yashas` and is assigned to yashasg; do not work on it.

### Application to Stage 2 Batch

All four Stage 2 agents (Frank, Linus, Rusty, Basher) explicitly deferred issue #4 (runtime training-loader contamination guard). #4 is marked `squad:yashas` and assigned to yashasg; Squad does not touch it. Manifest builder, manifest reader, emitter, and quality scorer all operate on artifacts only; no training-loop imports.

**Outcome:** Directive honored; no Squad overreach into Squad:Yashas territory.

## Decision: Basher — Stage 1 local manifest + trainer JSONL convention (Issue #6)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Owner:** Basher (Training Engineer)
**Status:** Team approved

Until a `pyarrow` dependency is explicitly accepted, `scripts/301_build_stage1_dataset.py` emits the Stage 1 manifest as stdlib JSONL at `data/stage1/stage1_manifest.jsonl`, not Parquet. The trainer-facing pre-tokenization pack is `data/stage1/stage1.jsonl.gz`; the token-volume gate report is `data/stage1/token_target_report.json`.

**Rationale:** This keeps the local Stage 1 build runnable with the current repo dependencies while preserving an exact schema contract via `--print-schema` and build-time validation. Corpus payloads remain under gitignored `data/`; no raw or trainer text is committed.

**Implications:**
- Training configs may point at `data/stage1/stage1.jsonl.gz` for local Stage 1 CPT runs.
- Tokenized `.bin` / `.npy` packing remains a later tokenizer-dependent step after Rusty's tokenizer audit.
- Parquet promotion is a follow-up dependency decision, not a blocker for issue #6.

## Decision: Linus — Canonical eval-hash ledger + FineWeb-2 split policy (Issues #2–#3)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Owner:** Linus (Data Engineer)
**Status:** Team approved

For the prototype, the canonical eval-hash contamination ledger is JSONL at `data/evals/eval_hashes.jsonl`. Each held-out hash row must carry at minimum: `schema_version`, `sha256_normalized`, `hash_method=sha256`, `normalization_method=NFC`, `origin`, `stage=eval-only`, `division`, `split`, `row_id`.

**FineWeb-2 split policy:** `scripts/310_split_dedupe_fineweb2_haw.py` owns the FineWeb-2 `haw_Latn` split/dedupe contract:
- Official test rows: 887
- Requested split: 70% dev / 30% holdout
- Rounding rule: `floor(test_rows * dev_ratio + 0.5)`
- Target counts: 621 dev, 266 holdout
- Split method: sort test rows by seeded stable row-id plus NFC-normalized text hash, take first target count as dev and remainder as holdout
- Division membership is by stable row id
- Contamination hashing is SHA-256 over NFC-normalized text
- Manifest must record requested ratio, target counts, actual counts, seed, split method, normalization method, and invariant checks including `train ∩ eval_hashes = ∅`

**Impact:** FineWeb-2, W1 manual eval, Stage 1, and Stage 2 contamination checks now point at the same ledger contract. Parquet is a future optional mirror only; if implemented, it must be derived from JSONL, not a second source of truth.

## Decision: Rusty — Stage-0 tokenizer audit gate for Llama-3.1-8B (Issue #8)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Owner:** Rusty (NLP Researcher)
**Status:** Team approved

Use `scripts/040_tokenizer_audit.py` as the lightweight, local-only tokenizer audit path before any serious Llama-3.1-8B Stage-1 spend. Reports are written under ignored `data/tokenizer_audit/` and must record: model id, resolved model repo SHA when available, tokenizer fingerprint SHA-256, input sample paths/sources, overall metrics, high-diacritic slice metrics, and a `recommendation.decision` of `go` or `no_go`.

**Default no-spend gate policy:**
- Minimum sample coverage: at least 1,500 words and 10 high-diacritic samples
- High-diacritic sample definition: `ʻokina + kahakō >= 3` and `diacritics/word >= 0.25`
- Go thresholds: overall tokens/word ≤ 2.50; high-diacritic tokens/word ≤ 3.25; explicit `<0x..>` byte fallback rate = 0; combined byte-fallback/proxy token rate ≤ 1%; standalone Hawaiian diacritic chars tokenize to ≤2 tokens each
- Any miss is `no_go` for serious 8B Stage-1 spend until a fallback tokenizer is audited or a vocab/embedding policy is chosen

**Notes for other agents:**
- The script intentionally fails with actionable install/login instructions if `transformers` is missing or gated Hugging Face Llama access is unavailable. Do not fabricate audit results.
- Basher: treat `code/configs/llama31_8b_a100.json` as blocked until a real report says `go` and its tokenizer/model SHA fields are frozen in the Stage-1 manifest.
- Linus: sample rows should come from local ignored data and cover nūpepa, Baibala, and contemporary/manual eval slices where possible.

## Decision: Linus — FineWeb-2 Stage-1 prototype cleaning policy (Issue #5)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Owner:** Linus (Data Engineer)
**Status:** Team approved

FineWeb-2 `haw_Latn` rows fetched by `205` and split/deduped by `310` are still raw web rows. Stage-1 training JSONL must be gated by `301_build_stage1_dataset.py` before use.

**Prototype cleaning policy in `301`:**
- Normalize all training text to Unicode NFC
- Canonicalize likely Hawaiian ʻokina variants (U+2018, U+2019, U+02BC, backtick, ASCII apostrophe in Hawaiian-letter context) to U+02BB
- Split FineWeb rows into paragraphs and re-gate each paragraph with the current cheap Hawaiian heuristic
- Drop timestamp/synopsis/navigation/ad/social-widget/URL-heavy boilerplate paragraphs
- Drop exact repeated normalized paragraph fingerprints after first sighting as a template-removal prototype
- Reject rows with no surviving paragraphs or with a failing row-level post-clean Hawaiian score
- Report raw and cleaned token counts, row/paragraph reject reason counts, diacritic density, and source/register token summaries under ignored `data/` outputs

**Local run result (621-dev / 266-holdout FineWeb split):**
- FineWeb rows seen: 95,507
- FineWeb rows rejected by cleaning: 6,528
- Raw vs cleaned Stage-1 train tokens: 59,534,611 → 44,067,289 (26.1% reduction)
- FineWeb train slice: 79,812 rows; raw 59,290,760 vs cleaned 43,843,711 tokens

**Follow-up:** Near-duplicate handling beyond exact text and repeated paragraphs is planned: build MinHash/LSH signatures over cleaned FineWeb + `hawwiki` + `hawwikisource` paragraphs/docs, persist cluster IDs, enforce cluster-aware eval/final isolation.

## Decision: Rusty — W1 manual eval local hash policy (Issue #7)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Owner:** Rusty (NLP Researcher)
**Status:** Proposed for team approval

W1 manual micro-eval rows remain local/off-git at `data/evals/manual_w1/w1-haw-micro-eval.tsv`. The eval-hash ledger remains the canonical JSONL file at `data/evals/eval_hashes.jsonl`.

**`manual_w1` ledger rows use:**
- `schema_version=eval-hashes-jsonl-v1`
- `origin=manual_w1`
- `stage=eval-only`
- `division=evals`
- `split=w1` for accepted rows; local draft preflight rows use their review status as split
- `row_id=<item_id>`
- SHA-256 over UTF-8 bytes of NFC-normalized `prompt + U+000A + reference`

**W1 TSV categories:** `okina_survival`, `kahako_retention`, `unicode_nfc`, `tokenizer_survival`, `generation_sanity`. Harness slices consume `category`, `diacritic_density`, and derived `diacritic_density_bin` (`none` = 0, `low` = 1–2, `medium` = 3–5, `high` ≥ 6).

**Guardrail:** `scripts/315_hash_manual_w1_eval.py` hashes only `review_status=accepted` rows by default. The explicit `--include-draft-for-local-ledger` path is local contamination preflight only; non-accepted ledger rows are marked `eval_consumable=false` and `prototype_local=true` and must not be reported as eval results.

**Rationale:** Reviewed Hawaiian rows require human review. The project can validate the local path, Unicode checks, category/slice contracts, and contamination ledger wiring with clearly marked draft rows while avoiding a fabricated public benchmark.

## Decision: Linus — Stage-2 manifest contract (Issue #11)

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Owner:** Linus (Data Engineer)
**Status:** Team approved

For the private prototype, the canonical Stage-2 manifest artifact is JSONL at `data/stage2/stage2_manifest.jsonl`. Any Parquet form is a future derived mirror only and must not become a parallel source of truth.

**Contract details:**
- `scripts/320_build_stage2_manifest.py --print-schema` is the schema surface for downstream consumers
- `scripts/330_emit_stage2_sft_jsonl.py` consumes `stage2_manifest.jsonl` and emits `data/stage2/stage2_sft.jsonl` by default
- `release_eligible` remains in manifest and SFT JSONL provenance; private prototype rows default to `prototype_only=true`, `release_eligible=false`
- Schema/enforcement: `prototype_only=true ⟹ release_eligible=false` is enforced as a schema/check violation
- Raw/generated artifacts stay under ignored `data/`

## Decision: Danny — Prototype issue closure review policy (Issue #9 Epic closure)

**Date:** 2026-04-29T13:15:04Z
**Owner:** Danny (Lead / Architect)
**Status:** Team approved

For the Ralph review loop, classify issues by prototype acceptance, not production/release completeness:

1. **READY_TO_CLOSE:** Issue acceptance criteria satisfied by local artifacts and smoke validation for private prototype. Does **not** imply public-release readiness, legal/cultural clearance, or GPU budget permission.

2. **BLOCKED_HUMAN_REVIEW:** Remaining gate is Hawaiian-literate judgement or external gated access, not repo work. Do not fabricate benchmark rows (#7) or tokenizer audit results (#8).

3. **Stage-2 skeleton/source-plan work can close** when contract, schema, docs, and smoke tests are internally consistent, even with zero real Stage-2 rows. Trade-off: faster evolutionary architecture now, explicit follow-up issues for adapters/fetching later.

4. **Do not close skeleton issue when contract is internally inconsistent.** Hold #11 (and therefore #9) until Stage-2 JSONL-first manifest contract is reconciled across docs/scripts (stage2_manifest.jsonl vs stale parquet references, output naming, release_eligible tension).

**Application:** Issue #9 epic and all sub-issues (#10–#14) closed after Linus reconciled Stage-2 contract. #11 validation: py_compile 320/321/330, `320 --dry-run --print-schema`, targeted stale-name grep all passed.
